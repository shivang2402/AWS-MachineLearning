# AWS-MachineLearning

Introduction
AWS Academy Machine Learning Foundations! This course provided me with a comprehensive understanding of machine learning concepts and how to implement them using various AWS services. In this README file, you will find important information and instructions related to the course, specifically focusing on AWS S3, SageMaker, Forecast, Computer Vision, Lambda.

Course Overview
The AWS Academy Machine Learning Foundations course covers a range of AWS services that are commonly used in machine learning projects. The main services covered in this course include:

AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service): S3 is an object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve large amounts of data. It provides scalable storage for your datasets, models, and other ML resources. In this course, you will learn how to create S3 buckets, upload and download data, manage access permissions, and integrate S3 with other AWS services.

AWS Glue: Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy to prepare and load data for analysis. You will learn how to use Glue to discover, catalog, and transform your data to make it ready for machine learning tasks. Additionally, you will explore Glue's capabilities for data cleaning, data deduplication, and data transformation.

AWS SageMaker: SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides end-to-end machine learning workflows. It allows you to build, train, deploy, and manage machine learning models at scale. Throughout the course, you will learn how to use SageMaker to create notebooks, preprocess data, train models using built-in algorithms or custom code, deploy models as endpoints, and monitor model performance.

AWS Forecast: Forecast is a fully managed service for time series forecasting. You will learn how to use Forecast to create accurate forecasts for your business needs. This includes importing and preparing your data, training forecasting models, generating forecasts, and evaluating the accuracy of the predictions.

Computer Vision: In addition to the services mentioned above, the AWS Academy Machine Learning Foundations course also covers Computer Vision concepts and their implementation using AWS services. Computer Vision involves analyzing and understanding visual data, such as images and videos, using machine learning techniques. You will learn how to leverage AWS services like Amazon Rekognition to perform image and video analysis tasks, including object detection, facial analysis, and content moderation.

AWS Ground Truth: AWS Ground Truth is a service that helps you build highly accurate training datasets for machine learning models. It provides human-in-the-loop capabilities, allowing you to annotate and label your data using a combination of automated and manual processes. You will learn how to use Ground Truth to create labeling jobs, define labeling workflows, and manage the annotation process for your computer vision projects. Ground Truth ensures the quality and accuracy of your labeled datasets, which are essential for training accurate machine learning models.

AWS Lambda: AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and logging. With Lambda, all you need to do is supply your code in one of the language runtimes that Lambda supports.

AWS Lex: Lex is a service for building conversational interfaces using voice and text. You will discover how to build chatbots and conversational agents using Lex. This includes designing and training chatbot models, defining intents and utterances, and integrating the chatbot with messaging platforms or other applications.

AWS CLI (Command Line Interface): The AWS CLI is a tool that enables you to interact with AWS services from the command line. You will need to install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine to perform various tasks throughout the course.
